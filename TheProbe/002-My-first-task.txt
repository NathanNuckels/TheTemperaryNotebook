The ion stage is long gone. The only system left uses nucular fusion.
Its clean, simple, powerfull, even if it is quite difficult.
I don't need to know how it works. I just need to know how to use it.
Its powered by fusing hydrogen into helium. You can also take helium and fuse it
into oxygen but the helium is shot out of it at extreemly high speeds
and you aint getting it back. Anyway, I need hydrogen, and I can get it from
Tellus-IV. Thats the fourth planet.
