Hello.

Hello. I am am a self replicating probe, sent to Taulait (Tau-Light).
I am very glad to be sent to Taulait because its the interesting one.
We have reason to suspect that there is inteligent life here.
I made my way over here through somthing simaler to a rail gun
and spent twenty Meros (about ten tellurian years) decelerating
using an ion engine. Oh, and by 'tellurian' I am refering to
the third planet from Tauliet, Tellius. It sticks out like a sore
thumb! Its so colorfull with greens blues and white while everything else here
kinda all looks the same to me.

Just in case some future civilization finds this I should define what
an ion engine is.
