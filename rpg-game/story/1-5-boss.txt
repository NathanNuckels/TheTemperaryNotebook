Inspired by Paper Mario (2001)

Chapter one boss: "Dragon" (With quotes)
Its a red draggon! But its made of cardboard...?

"Dragon" stats:
    HP: 150
    Defence: 1
    It looks a little odd, dosn't it?
    Attacks:
        Spit: [2] A ball gets 'thrown' out of its mouth.
        Stomp: [5]

Every three turns, the player is alloued to roll for investigation with a DC of 17.
If it passes, The name changes from '"Dragon"' to 'Kobold Piñata' and makes this dialouge:

Zipline: I know you're just a bunch of Kobolds!
Miẑka: No we're not!
Ĥaklang: Uhh, do somthing a draggon would do!
Mauri: ROAR! I LIKE GOLD! HAND OVER YOUR SWARD!
(<sward> not <sword>. It's pernounced /sʊaɹd/)
