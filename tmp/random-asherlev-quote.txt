PBA: Is it important to belong?

Once you're finished reading write 2-5
sentences about how Asher's sence of
belonging is portrayed in chapter 12. You must
include ONE direct quote from the chapter to
support yuor answer.

Quote:
     "Because I'm part of a tradition, Papa. Mastery of the art
form of the nude is very important to that tradition, Every im-
portant artist who ever lived drew or painted the nude."
     "Art is a tradition."
     "Yes."

(Page 304, Line 5, Written with original typesetting)

This is the only thing I could find in chapter twelve that has anything remotly to do wiht
belonging.
