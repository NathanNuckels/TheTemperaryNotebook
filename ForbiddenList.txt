I would have tagged them as double hostile AND mysterious if I could.
They are very~~~~ ya know.... well... I don't...
Deeply mysterious. They don't attack very often, but when they do,
they REALLY attack! Of course, this is very rare that they will attack on any one day
but if there is an attack on one day, there's probibly six more coming!
Attacks most on Tuesday when its a B day. I think.... I don't really know.
Their whole quirk is that they are never helpful at all. This leads people
to come up with "interesting" solutions. What can I say, they are paied to help
people and chooses not to (and still gets paied technically) so of couse
some very strange "problem solving" will happen. I'm not saying there is a revolution
about to happen but I an DEFINITLY not saying there isn't...

Its a form of science so complicated, you'll think it isn't even real! But oh boy, its real
and yes, I prefer astro-physics but this seems simple to me even if it is the most complicated part of science.
Clean record, of course. Writes stuff to help you remember things. The things they write are stupid
but oddly enough, they work very well. Achedemically, they're a trainwreck but behaviorly, they are one of the only
people I can trust in this school. If I trust them then why are they on the list? Well, when scrolling the
list of bad people, I toss in some good people so that you can restore your faith in humanity.

We literally know nothing about this man. Why is he on the list??

Angel B
We ommitted her last name. She is very "nice".
Ok, she is actually nice. Very nice. She is very nice... with one exception.
TELL US THE HECCIN DUE DATES!!! WHY ARN'T WE ALLOUED TO KNOW???
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE JOB TRAINING!!
Wait... mabee this is how jobs actually work...
No wonder melenials are always tired, its capitalism!
Anyway, she is honestly very nice to everyone but the work she assigns us
is not possible in the time alloued. I get that this is job training and thats how the 
real world works but seriously! She has no boss. If she wants us to have more time, we would have more time.

Angel H
This is a code name. Its a dude, and his name starts with H.
Not to sound gay but hes pretty cool. Not to sound streight but he's pretty odd.
Wait... I have a quote for this!

"No I'm not sick, I took all my vitemins.
 No I'm not sick, I'm just kinda different
 ...
 You're just like me, You took all your vitemins.
 You're just like me~ and you take delight in it.
 ...
" Wow, I'm not crazy (AJR)

That's our relationship. That right there. That quote.
The reason we like eachother is becasue we are basically identacal.
...and everyone else hates us
...and we are excomunicated from society
...and hate capitalism
...and he accepts me for who I am, unlike most teachers
...and I trust him with information, unlike most parents
...and-- Ok. You get it. Everyone hates me except him wich makes him automatically, my best friend.
We would be even beter friends if he didn't dissapear mysteriously all the time.
(Its been a VERY long time)
So come on guy! I need someone to animate with!
Someone that won't punch me in the face due to what I'm animating...)
Someone that won't set my notebooks of fire...)
Someone that... Ok, you get the idea...
Someone that agrees with me. Not to push an agenda, or to steal information,
Someone that genuinly is interested in me. Not for spying, not for teaching, not for
blackmail, not for pushing an agenda, not for invalidating ny identity, not for sending threats,
and to reitterate, not for blackmail!!!

Wait a minute... Did I finally define what a "friend" is?
This is an achevement. Alan, Go copy paste this paragraph into the poetry folder!
