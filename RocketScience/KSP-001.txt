4. Head streight up for arround 5 to 10 secconds.
5. Start pitching north.
6. Turn at a rate where once you reach 10km, you should be at the 45 degree line.

9. Watch your tragectory's length. Go sideways to make it longer.
10. Nervoiusly wait for 70km
11. After 70km Do science! Mystery goo, Barromiter, thermomiter, crew report, and EVA report. Do it all!!!

21. Want to plant a flag? It feels odd putting it on your home planet but do it. Just for fun.

Now you have 100-ish science

Unlock these:
Basic Science
If you can afford it, get advanced rocketry and stability.
If you can't, do this next mission.

With Basic Science, you now have the Science Jr, the most powerfull early/mid game item!!


MISSION 3 - Mx 3
We need a little more science

    MK16 parachute
    MK1 Command pod
    Science Jr
    Heat Shield
    Decuppler
    FLT-400 If you havn't unlocked advanced rocketry, just use two FLT-200s
    FLT-400 This part is exactically the same as the rocket above.
    FLT-200
    Swivel

BEFORE YOU CLICK LAUNCH
make sure ther is a SCIENTIST in the rocket!

All the steps are the same as above but sue the Science Jr.
Use it on the launchpad, in space, and while waiting to land and after you land.

Ok. Now you're ready to leave Kirbin!
