Lets say there are three orbtis.
Kerbin, Duna, and You.
The SMA of Kerbin is 13 599 840 256
The SMA of Duna is 20 726 155 264 m
Whats the SMA of the transfer orbit?
(13599840256+20726155264)/2
17 162 997 760 m
Now you can calculate the time it takes to complete an orbit,
the orbital period.

tau*sqrt(SMA^3/GM)
GM of Kerbol is 1.1723328*10^18 m3/s2
tau*sqrt(17162997760^3/(1.1723328*10^18))
13 048 005 s
but we only need to travel half of that.
6 524 002 s
So during this 6 million secconds, How far does Duna travel?
Duna's orbital period is 17 282 634 s
Multiply by 360 to convert it to degrees.
(6524002/17282634)*360
we get 135.89.
subtract it from 180 to find out how far Duna WONT trvel in that time.
180-135.89
44.11
Ok. Go to Matt Lowne's youtube and click literally any video about Duna.
He always says the transfer window is 45 degrees.

One more important thing to note. If you do all this math and you wind up with
a negitave number, the target planet must be BEHIND you instead of ahead.

All of this assumes the orbits are perfectly circular.
Do not use this for places like Moho or Eeloo.

Eccentricity math coming soon!
