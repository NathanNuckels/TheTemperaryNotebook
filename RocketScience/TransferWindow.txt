Lets calculate the transfer window!

but first, I want to see if I can calculate orbital periods
(transfer windows rely a lot on orbital periods)

So I'll calculate it for Kerbin.

T = tau*(sqrt(a^3/GM))
where tau is 2*pi
      a is the semi major axis
      M is the mass of the star
      and G is the magic gravity number idk
M*G for Kerbol is 1172332800000000000 cubic meters per seccond squared.
Semi-major axis os Kerbin is 13599840256m
a^3/GM is 2145608600000
Wich gives the final result of
9203544.55231.... secconds? days? I guess We'll find out.
According to the wiki, the orbital period of Kerbin is
9 203 545 seccods.
Wow, Thats like, spot on!!

Anyway, for the rest of this, we will just use the ones off of the wiki.

First thing is to figure out how long it will take to get from Kerbin ot Duna.

Lets make a hypothetical transfer orbit. Make the periapsys Kerbin,
and the apolapsys Duna
Q = 20726155264m q = 13599840256m
To see how long it will take to travel arround this orbit, we need the orbital period,
and to get the period, we need to get the semi-major axis.
Also, the prbital period is how long it takes to do one full orbit,
a round trip. We only want half of that. If you mash all of this into an equation,
you get this.

sqrt(((Q+q)/2)^3/GM)*pi*2
wich is
sqrt(((1359984025+20726155264)/2)^3/1172332800000000000)*pi
 = 3367124.1631 secconds.

Heres why transfer windows are important, Duna, Kerbin, and you all move at different speeds.
The speed of Kerbin dosn't matter right now but you need to know how far Duna will move.
You will go 180 degrees arround the transfer orbit and it will take roughly 3367124/21600=
155.8 in game days. You will go 180 degrees. How far will duna travel?
Well, a full duna orbit is 17 315 400 so its basic math.
Duna * X = You
You / Duna = X
3367124/17315400 *360 = 70 (the * 360 is to make it in degrees)
The correct andwer is 44.......
