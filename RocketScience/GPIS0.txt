Go Play In Space KSP
Loosly based on Go Play In Space by Bruce Irving

I know this book is supposed to be about Kerbal Space Program
but I'm going to talk about the technical details of some other games.

Getting games to work on Linux is very easy.

KSP has a native Linux version. If it dosn't work, you can make steam
use Valve Proton if neccisary. (Search '!archwiki steam' in duckduckgo 
for details)

Running CKAN on Linux needs mono, wich I assume is a fork of wine.
The linux version of CKAN usually dosn't work.
get the windows version and run it through mono.
('mono CKAN.exe')
Mono can be installed through your local package manager (pacman -S mono)
probibly. On arch based distros, make sure you enable multilib in
/etc/pacman.conf.

Now that you're in CKAN, I have a few segestions.
Click filters, then tags, then convienence. Then add 'is:compatible'
in the search bar and scroll through to see if you find anything you like.
Make sure to get Kerbal Engineer Redux.

If you have a beefy computer you might beable to handle
visual mods. Get Enviromental Visual Enhancements,
Astronomers Visual Pack, Scatterer, and Waterfall.
When you install them you will need to select what
size texures you want for AVP and what solar flare you want for
Scatterer.

I tested these visual mods on an AMD Rysen 9 Radeon 6800 on Artix Linux
and it worked and was beutiful, but be warned! I also tried it on an old
laptop with an nVidia GeForce GTX 1060 on Windows NT 11 and although it
was beutiful as well, it was EXTREEMLY slow and you couldn't touch the bottom
of the laptop without burning yourself so when I say you need a good computer,
I mean a GOOOOOD computer!!

Now you can launch the game.... Now what?
