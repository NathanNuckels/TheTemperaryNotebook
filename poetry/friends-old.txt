Wait... I have a quote for this!

"No I'm not sick, I took all my vitemins.
 No I'm not sick, I'm just kinda different
 ...
 You're just like me, You took all your vitemins.
 You're just like me~ and you take delight in it.
 ...
" Wow, I'm not crazy (AJR)

That's our relationship. That right there. That quote.
The reason we like eachother is becasue we are basically identacal.
...and everyone else hates us
...and we are excomunicated from society
...and hate capitalism
...and he accepts me for who I am, unlike most teachers
...and I trust him with information, unlike most parents
...and-- Ok. You get it. Everyone hates me except him wich makes him automatically, my best friend.
We would be even beter friends if he didn't dissapear mysteriously all the time.
(Its been a VERY long time)
So come on guy! I need someone to animate with!
Someone that won't punch me in the face due to what I'm animating...)
Someone that won't set my notebooks of fire...)
Someone that... Ok, you get the idea...
Someone that agrees with me. Not to push an agenda, or to steal information,
Someone that genuinly is interested in me. Not for spying, not for teaching, not for
blackmail, not for pushing an agenda, not for invalidating ny identity, not for sending threats,
and to reitterate, not for blackmail!!!

Wait a minute... Did I finally define what a "friend" is?
This is an achevement. Alan, Go copy paste this paragraph into the poetry folder!
