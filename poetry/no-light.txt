I watch the sunset and write my name in the sand.
Heh... Thats nice...
This is gonna take a while...
This island
is confined
I go to my cave.
Ive been on this island for so long now I don't remember
I dont
I can't remember THE BEFORE.
I look down the cave that I dug into a tunnel
I noticed somthing concerning
Somthing very concerning.
The light at the end of the tunnel burnt out.
And I must now sleep in darkness.
But it was burning so bright just yesterday
It made me think it would never go out,
but here it is... was.... Or was it never there to begin with?
This wasn't an issue the first time bcasue I had my own light
to replace it but now
The lightbulb has burnt out
And I can't replace it.
On this island confined by water
I hope that there is somthing ANYTHING
I can use as a replacement.
I remember there was some copper in this cave
so although there is no light at the end of the tunnel tonight,
I can make a new one tomarrow afternoon
when the sun shines just right in my cave
at roughly five past noon
and I can see everything I need all at once
Oh, copper, did I mention that I have electricity in here?!
Sometimes I forget to be thankfull for the resources that I have
especially if I can't use them.
So tomarrow
at five past noon
The sun will align
and light up my cave
and I can make a new light
to put at the end of the tunnel
but untill then,
I lie
in
complete
darkness
I wich someone could give me a light
just SOMTHING to put in the light's place
but I'm confind to an island
and no one can help me now
and although I will have all the light I need
tomarrow afternoon,
and I will keep some of it through the night
but right now
I sit and wait
in comelete darkness.
