COMPPOSITION

//The orange dashed line on the graph.
//Please send details I don't remember what that like is EXACTICALLY
//but i do know that it is 75-ish% sillacate like earth and mars.

The planet is 76% sillacate with a 24% iron core.
//PLEASE VERIFY WITH ARTIFEXIAN. 

* Assumes a year is EXACTICALLY 365 days.
One Siderial year is roughly 365.256363004 days.

See misferuus.txt for details. There is a LOT to say about this place...

Flizh Commonwealth /flɪʒ.kɑ.mɪn.welθ/

Flizh (from 'fresh') refers to the ice caps of Mosphere
wich are 'fresher' than the equator. Once again, although the planet
is quite diverse, the world was originally shaped by cyborgs, and comptuers
get hot! No biological life lives here (I mena they CAN be there, you can
go outside with no cloths in -10 degree wether and live but you aint gonna
like it!) The Synths in this reigon are called 'the great minds'. They tend
to be arcetects and artists but also engineers and pholosiphers. This is where
cold fusion was invented. (Nucular fission splits atoms, thats what humans 
use. Nucular fusion is really hot and only happens in the sun. Cold fusion is
any fusion that isn't at ten bajillion degrees.)
They take a lot of pride in their inventions. Living Protogens also
go here to learn for the Synths but since they are living, they can't
stand the cold. Zombie Protogens (Basically the same as Synths) sometimes
visit family here.

Its name is misleading. It has no governemnt and is an anarchy.
The "commonwealth" refers to the ideas these Synths create.
There is no crime becasue 1. No one really owns anything so no stealing, 2.
There is basically no local internet so ideas can't be stolen, 3. everyone
has 'acended' and knows that 'crime will only hurt themselves'. Sounds like
a weak system but when everyone's an existential phelosipher then you
can probibly trust them.
