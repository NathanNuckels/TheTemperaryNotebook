HYPERSPACE HYPOSPACE

A shapespare-ish type explanation of hyperspace.
Words in squeare brackets are not spoken, they are implied.

TEKNIQ: [Why are you] 'Up so early?
KELIDES: Yeah. Phoenix needs a ride here. Gonna hyperspace soon. Glad you're awake.
TEKNIQ: Can you explain hyperspace again?
KELDIES: Its a dimention smaller than our own.
TEKNIQ: Should be called hypo-space if its smaller...
KELDIES: Thirty two times smaller but only while you're moving.
TEKNIQ: Huh?

(Keldies pulls out his PEN, tosses it in the air and when he catches it,
they both enter the Sketch Relm)

KELIDES: Ok, os if you are moving, you have a direction of travel, right?
(He draws a arrow and a line off the front of it)
KELDIES: Prograde, the direction of travel.
(He draws a line off the back)
KELDIES: This is the opposite of the direction of travel, retrograde.
KELDIES: Both of them combined make the prograde axis. You get it?
TEKNIQ: You could have explaned that better but I guess I get it.
KELDIES: Well, on this prograde axis, space is scaled to be 32 times smaller.
KELIDES: Thats how fast travel works.
KELIDES: But the rest of the world...
(He draws the "Y" and "Z" axies (assuming prograde is X))
KELDIES: Are not affected.
(TEKNIQ draws an oval)
TEKNIQ: So... planets look like this?
KELDIES: Yeah. Also if you're not moving...
(KELIDES draws a arrow-pointer somewhere else)
KELIDES: Nothing changes.
TEKNIQ: So what causes this?
KELIDES: "Relitivistic Affects"
KELIDES: This happens in real life near the speed of light.
KELDIES: The hyperspace dimention is special casue all the effects start at a mere one kilomiter per seccond
KELDIES: however it appears that its capped at 32 times smaller. Still convienent though.
TEKNIQ: I'll just device the travel time by 32 and not think about any of that...
TEKNIQ: Any dangers I should know about?
KELIDES: Somthing odd is that hyperspace is not a *real* dimention. Theres our dimention,
KELDIES: This inner dimention were in now wich is basically a low quality copy of our world
KELDIES: Hyperspace is between the inner and outer worlds. There's nothing there. No light.
KELIDES: Only darkness. Radar is alloued, to an extent.
TEKNIQ: Arnt radio waves just low frequency light?
KELIDES: Yes. VHF and UHF radio don't work but HF radio works.
TEKNIQ: Dosn't HF mean high frequency?
KELIDES: Well, yeah but in the grand scheme of things they are still quite low energy.
TEKNIQ: 20MHz and below, right?
KELDIES: Yup. All electromagnetic waves above 20 Megs (MHz) has its power segnificantly reduced.
KELIDES: ANd the higher the frequency, the lower the power untill... black.
KELIDES: Convienently, the maximum power for red light is enough for us to work. 
KELIDES: Blue light isn't powerfull enough to light up the room but we can still see it so
KELIDES: full color screens work, mostly.
KELIDES: Anyway, we will also turn off gravity to save electricity.
KELIDES: We can't generate electricity in hyperspace cause, ya know, no light.

TEKNIQ: So, to summerize, use HF radio to communicate, use red lights to see. No gravity.

KELDIES: Pretty much. Lets smap back to reality. Phoenix dosn't have much time before he is found out.
KELIDES: Hes trying to sneak out, I don't think I mentioned that...
KELDIES: Anyway, to Tellus* we go! (*Earth)

(KELDIES turns the ship so that the crisshair points to the target on the HUD)
(Rizing sound)

(Sound effect from an Oolite mod)
A-VOICE: FIVE FOUR 
(All ambient noise suddenly stops. A deafining scilenece)
A-VOICE: THREE TWO HWONE* JUMPING. (* pernounced oddly)

(Black screen, Total darkness)

(...)

(.....)

(Click. Red lights turn on, the HUD displays a crosshair, and a target square in green to contrast the red)
(All colors are shifted. Split the video into its red green and blue channels. Delete the blue channel,
devide the green by two, and don't change the red.)
(White is orange, blue is black, Cyan is dark green, Purple is dark red...)
