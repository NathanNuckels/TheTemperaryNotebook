A shakespare like script of Keldies and Percius exchanging insults. There are several footnotes.

(They strall grimly in light snow.)
PERCIUS: KXAH!* Glad to see you back! [*hah!]

KELDIES: Oh, I don't think so. I never wanted to be here.

PERCIUS: Oh? Why not?

KELIDES: You coax me in with promices of new technology and all you do is try
to explain at length why I am worse in comparason to the others and you have the
audacity to assume Ihd return vollentarily? Pish...

PERCIUS: Looks like you don't get a choice. You know that. We have to be together
but we dont have to fight.

KELDIES: Oh yes we do. You need to finish what you started, Percius. Taking
complete controll over a totally uninhabitable planet more sparce than Tellus's*
Moon. You named it after yourself, made a political party that demanded absolute
controll and built an army of misinformed instanes of artificial inteligence.
You shall be along with the lowest scum in the Stellius system being thrusted
towards the Sagitarius-A black hole. [*Earth's]

PERCIUS: Don't forget you've caused your fair hare of trouble. You made an
engineering startup with a "dead man's switch". The moment I kicked you out of
the company, everything went haywire!

KELIDES: That was deserved.

PERCIUS: You influenced the Mispheruus Government to bend to your will!

KELDIES: Not MY will, I'll ave you know I had 30% of the country on my side.

PERCIUS: And the other seventy?

KELIDES: They were unaware it was going on and therefore undecided.

PERCIUS: You made food and water free!

KELDIES: ...is that a problem?

PERCIUS: No one would make food without profit and if people can't work for a
living, mabee they shouldn't be living at all.

KELDIES: Food would be made not for profit, but for the benifet of the species
as a whole. [Sarcastic[ Oh and waht fools to [mocking] CHOOSE to be born poor,
and in the arctic, and lost in orbit, and underground, and---

PERCIUS: You did a war crime!

KELIDES: Wich? and in what war?

PERCIUS: You captured a human. War crime. You TRANSFURED a human AND have them
HIGHER DIMENTINAL ACESSS FOR FASTER THAN LIGHT TRAVEL!

KELDIES: Calm your bloody, shakey, biological nerves, you botched batch of
carbon-12 atoms. Sure we kidnapped him but he had plans to return him. And as for
the transfur, it was the best moment of his entire life. It was the only thing he
ever wanted. He just wanted to escape his old human life. Listen, the man deserves
a metal but he's never really won a prize before. [Reference to Jonny Boy by Twenty 
One Pilots]

PERCIUS: Still a war crime, even if there was no war.

KELDIES: Its ok to beam up victums of captialism if they consent.

PERCIUS: YOU LITERALLY WROTE THT LAW YOURSELF!

KELIDES: AT LEAST I WON THE POPULAR VOTE, YOU STOLE A PLANET!

PERCOIS: THERE WERE NO NATIVES NO NOBODY CARED!

KELDIES: YOU---

[Enter AUGUST]

PERCIUS: Oh, Augyst, my little... uhh... somthing or another... Sorry you had to-

AUGUST: 'not.

PERCIUS: What?

AUGUST: 'not your sister.

PERCIUS: Wern't we blood related? It was just a few years ago. Can't you remember?

AUGUST: I don't have blood.

PERCIUS: He does.

KELIDES: Nope. I have no heart or lungs so I can't really use my blood. I just threw it out.

PRECIUS: AHAH! YOU HEARTLESS INTEL CELERON! 

KELDIES: No one calls me a 'celeron. [Flames on his ears.]

[A pause]

KELIDES: Comrade.

PERCIUS: Commander.

KELIDES: To a sustainable future of the Communist Mispherus Empire.

PERCIUS: To a profitable future for the Percius Dictatorship.

[They slowly move closer and shake hands]

[PERCIUS slas KELDIES out of the blue and walks away]

KELDIES: Gahh.

AUGUST: "Percius Dictatorship"? Thats the most arrogent thing I've ever heared!

KELDIES: Well, you aint seen nothing yet.
