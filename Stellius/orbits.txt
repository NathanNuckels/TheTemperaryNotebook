All orbits

When I say 'simaler to' I mean interms of the size of the orbit,
not the fetures of the planet.
In perinthasies is the government of the planet.
Sure earth may have roughly 150 countries
but in world building, normally each planet is one country,
and one spiecies. (Except the 'main character' planet, wich is Mosphere)

0.12 INNER LIMIT
0.162 [SKIPPED]
0.22 insert mercury analog here. Lots of metal, but also flamin' hot.
0.35 [DO NOT SKIP]
0.668 I was thinking of putting somthing like venus here
1.069 Simaler to Earth
1.4 Aquerius (Anarchal Akverius) HABITABLE
1.8 Mosphere-X86 (Communist Misferuus Empire*) HABITABLE
3.5 Percius-394 (Pitan Dictatorship)

40 add some lil dumb drawf planet here larger than makemake but smaller than pluto
46.79 
47.895 add somthing like Pluto here. Cold, empty, people only go  for street cred.
48 OUTER LIMIT. NO PLANETS BEOND THIS POINT
49 Lets be quirky and put a dwarf planet at 49AU cause I want to.

*Name under debate. 'Communist Mospheros' and 'Commuist Mofesia'
are being considered. The boring 'Communist Mosphere' will NOT
be used. We are thinking of adding 'Empire' to the end of the name too.
Also thinking of 'MOSFET' like the transister. 'MOFSET' is a common
typo.

**Also under debate. Try 'Persaan', 'Purgean' (as in purge) or 
'Perishan' (as in perish). 'Persion' and 'Persian' refer to the middle
east, and 'Pegan' is also a real word (idk what it means) so they
are not alloued. The term 'Confederacy' is also not alloued.
Its "Per___an Dictatorship" and that is final.

***This planet is up for viewers to vote on.
Requirements: Must be terrestrial, Should be simaler to Percius in
radius, It has large ice caps and be like Mars but orange.
(Mars has iron oxide wich is red, and this place also has sulpher
wich is yellow and red + yellow = orange. Note: The orange is
closer to red than yellow) Its name and whether it has a government,
are also up for you to decide!

****This planet is up for viewers to vote on.
Requirements: Must be a gas giant, Must not be pure hydrogen,
No clue what its core will be made of,
