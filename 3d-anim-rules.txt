For the Drive Safe thing, there arn't many rules.

The real rules are just keep it PG, followed by a leagal disclaimer.

But there are IMPLIED rules as well.

It is implied hat you MUST work on it during class.
If you must work on it in class, that implies that it must be 3D
because the school computers can't do anything else.

And finally, it is implied that we are not alloued to take breaks.
If this were a job instead of a school, that would be illeagal.

I have a few possible solutions:

I could taket my burner laptop to school. actually, I MUST!

Instructions:
Remove the AUTOSTART X feature from .bashrc
Switch the password to the extended password.
Disable NetworkManager, iwd and dhcpcd at school (No wifi for security)
Bring the charger.
To save battery power, DO NOT RENDER ANYTHING AT SCHOOL.
Move the blender project to its own SEPERATE git repository on the company gogs server
Bring the mouse.
Bring the drawing tablet just in case.
Bring a USB to copy files from Linux to Mac and back.
