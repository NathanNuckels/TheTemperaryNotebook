[Tyler alone]
I DON'T BOTHER ANYONE
NERVOUS WHEN I STAND
CHOKING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCE
ONLY SMOKIN SECCOND HAND
CUT US OPEN SPREAD US OUT
DRY US IN THE SAND
LAY THE FIBER SIDE BY SIDE
YOU'LL BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND

[Tyler gets off of the couch, LISDEN and SACARVER frozen in place.
The "Good Day DEMA" Background is sliding away to reveal theater red curtens.]

[Tyler and one octive up]
I KNOW ITS OVER
[Tyler alone]
I WAS BORN A CHOKER

[Text ppears on the screen.
TWENTY

Bottom right: DMA ORG (dema) and the Good Day logo.

[Tyler and one octive up]
NO~BODY'S COMIN FOR ME.

[Tyler walks behind the curten into an area with a "rainbow" of blue, pink
and yellow with Trash Draggon slithering through the ground and walls.
Josh Dun is in the middle and there is a Piano, (not Tyler's cusom one)
to the side.]
[Almost spoken]

[Live]
I DON'T BOTHER ANYONE
NEVER MAKE DEMANDS
CHOKING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCE
SELF SABATOUGHE??? IS A SWEET ROMANCE [Spelling: 'sabataughe' --> /sa.ba.tɔʒ]
SEEMS LIKE ALL I'M WORTH IS WHAT
I'M ABLE TO WITHSTAND
SOONER I CAN REALIZE THAT
PAIN IS JUST A MIDDLE MAN

[Same harmony as the first courus]
I KNOW ITS OVER
I WAS BORN A CHOKER
NOBODYS COMIN FOR ME

CAUSE
I KNOW ITS OVER
I WAS BORN A CHOKER
NOBODYS COMIN FOR ME
(ONLY SMOKIN SECCOND HAND)
I KNOW ITS OVER
I WAS BORN A CHOKER
NOBODYS COMIN FOR ME
[Short pause]
LIKE A LITTLE SPLIN'R [Splinter] BURRIED IN YOUR SKIN
SOMEONE ELSE CAN CARVE IT OUT BUT WHEN YOU GOT THE PIN
IT HURTS A LITTLE LESS AND YOU CAN EVEN PUSH IT FURTHER IN
WHEN YOUR BODY'S SCREAMIN OUT TRUST YOUR MIND IS LISTENIN
LIKE A CHILLOETTE THAT YOU CAN BARLEY SEE [Spelling: 'chilloette' --> /sɪl.əʊ.et/]
AS A SHADOW CAST UPON THE GROUND WHERE YOU'LL EVENTUALLY ['upon' or 'apon']
LAY FOREVER BUT THE DAY GOES ON THE SUN MOVES BEHIND YOU
YOU GET TALLER BOLDER STRINGER, AND THE REAR VIEW ONLY BLINDS---

(Blinds- blinds- blinds- blinds- blinds- blinds-)
[The 'deamons' or rather, bishops appear and forcefully pull tyler to the A stage, a tilted square
with steps and big screens for walls.]

[Pre recorded]
BLURRYFACE: USED TO PLAY PRETEND USED TO PLAY PRETEND MONEY.
BLURRYFACE: USED TO PLAY PRETEND WAKE UP YOU NEED THE MONEY.
BLURRYFACE: USED TO PLAY PRETEND USED TO PLAY PRETEND MONEY.
"CROUD": WAKE UP YOU NEED TO MAKE-
[Remixed from sound bytes]
TYLER: MONEY; ONLY SELL; WHAT!? (WHAT) ['only sell' is from 'only sell one']
[Drums start]
BLURRYFACE: USED TO PLAY PRETEND USED TO PLAY PRETEND MONEY.
BLURRYFACE: USED TO PLAY PRETEND WAKE UP YOU NEED THE MONEY.
BLURRYFACE: USED TO PLAY PRETEND USED TO PLAY PRETEND MONEY.
"CROUD": WAKE UP YOU NEED TO MAKE MONEY.

[Live; Tyler:]
I WISH I FOUND SOME ETTER SOUND NO ONE'S EVER HERD
I WISH I HAD A VOICE THAT SANG SOME BETTER WORDS
I WISH I FOUND SOME CORDS IN AN ORDER THT IS NEW.
I WISH I DIDNT HAVE TO RHYME EVER TIME I SANG
I WAS TOLD WHEN I GET OLDER ALL MY FEARS WOULD SHRINK
BUT NOW IM INSECURE AND I CARE WHAT PEOPLE THINK
[Pre-recorded, from album:]
MY NAME'S BLURRYFACE AND I- CARE WHAT YOU THINK
MY NAME'S BLURRYFACE AND I (I) CARE WHAT YOU--

[Live]
WISH WE COULD TURN BACK TIME

WHEN OUR MAMA SANG
US TO SLEEP BUT NOW WERE STRESSED OUT (OH)
WISH WE COULD TURN BACK TIME (OH)
TO THE GOOD OLD DAYS (OH)
WHEN OUR MAMA SANG
US TO SLEEP BUT NOW WERE STRESSED OUT

USED TO PLAY PRETEND GIVE EACHOTHER DIFFERENT NAMES

USED TO DREAM OF OUTER SPACE BUT NOW THEY LAUGHIN AT YOUR FACE SAYIN:
"CROUD": WAKE UP YOU NEED TO MAKE MONEY

[Tyler and muffled voices, possible prerecorded.]
SHADOWS WILL SCREAM THAT I'M A LONE -LONE -ONE

Tyler: [Yelling, probibly to the "audience"] Hey hey! Hey yo!

I- I- I- I GOT A MIGRANE
AND MY PAIN WILL RANGE FROM UP DOWN AND SIDE WAYS
THANK GOD ITS FRIDAY [[[]]] [line cencored. Will fix later.]

I DONT KNOW WHY THEY ALWAYS SEEM SO DISMAL
THUNDERSTORMS CLOUDS SNOW AND A SLIGHT DRISSLE
WHETHER ITS THE WHETHER OR THE LETTERS BY BED
SOMETIMES [[[]]] THAN THE MIGRANE IN MY HEAD [word cencored]
LET IT BE SAID WHAT THE HEADACHE REPRESENTS
ITS ME DEFENDING IN SUSPENCE ITS ME SUSPENDED IN A DEFENCELESS TEST
BEING TESTED BY A RUTHLESS EXAMINER BEST REPRESENTED BY MY DEPRES---
ONE TWO THREE!
---ING THOUGHTS I DO NOT HAVE WRITERS BLOCK, MY WRIGHTER JUST HATES THE CLOCK
IT WILL NOT LET ME SLEEP, I GUESS I'LL SLEEP WHEN I'M DEAD
AND SOMETIMES [[[]]] THAN THE MIGRANE IN MY HEAD [word cencored]

[The following is only part of my extended edit.]
AM I THE ONLY ONE I KNOW?
RAGING MY WARS BEHIND MY FACE AND ABOVE MY THROUGHT?
SHADOWS WILL SCREAM THAT I'M ALONE BUT I KNOW
WE MADE IT THIS FAR... KID.

I AM NOT AS FINE AS I SEAM
PARDON ME FOR YELLIN IM TELLIN YA
GREEN GARDENS ARE NOT WHATS GROWIN IN MY PHYCHE
ITS A DIFFERENT ME
A DIFFACULT A BEAST A FEASTING ON BURNT DOWN TREES [Some may say 'LUMBER DOWN TREES' instead.]
FREEZE FRAME, PLEASE
LET ME PAINT A MENTAL PICTURE PORTRIT
SOMTHING YOU WON'T FORGET ITS ALL ABOUT MY FOREHEAD
AND HOW IT IS A DOOR THAT HOLDS BACK CONTENTS
THAT MAKE PANDORAS BOX CONTENTS LOOK NON-VIOLENT
BEHIND MY EYELIDS ARE ISLANDS OF VILENCE
MY MIND SHIPWRECKED THIS IS THE ONLY THING MY MIND COULD
FIND. I DID NOT KNOW IT WAS SUCH A VIOLENT ISLAND,
BULLET TIDAL WAVES, [[[line deleted]]]
[[[line deleted]]]
AND I KNOW I CAN FIGHT OR I CAN LET THE LIONS WIN
I BEGIN TO ASSEMBLE [[line deleted]]
[[line deleted]]]

[End of extended section]

AM I THE ONLY ONE I KNOW?
RAGING MY WARS BEHIND MY FACE AND ABOVE MY THROUGHT?
SHADOWS WILL SCREAM THAT I'M ALONE BUT I KNOW
WE MADE IT THIS FAR... KID (KID KID KID KID KID)

[MORPH]

FOR ABOVE IS BLIND BELIFF, AND UNDER IS SWORD TO SLEEVE,
AND ARROUND IS SIENTIFIC MIRICAL LETS PICK ABOVE AND SEE
FOR IF AND WHEN WE GO ABOVE THE QUESTION STILL REMAINS
