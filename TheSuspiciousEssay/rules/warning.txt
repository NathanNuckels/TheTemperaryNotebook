These rules are never officially stated anywhere. These rules were written by me
and i discovered them through observation.

The rules mentioned are 100% correct, no exceptions, hoverver, there could be other
rules not listed here that you'll discover yourself.

The interpretation of the rules is pure speculation.

Remember how we should think of teachers.
They may be 'human', but they don't deserve to be called 'people'.
