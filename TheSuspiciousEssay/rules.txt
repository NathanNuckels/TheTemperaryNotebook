Sorry bro.



For the purposes of this text, assume the "enemy"
is auth-right, spesifically, half way between economic right
ad economoc center, and all the way authoritarian.

Also assume that the author is writing from a lib-left
point of view. (All the way libre, half between leftit and centerist)

These approximations are not correct but that are approximations.

This text is not a communist maifesto, it just feels like it
becasue you oppose it.

This text is, for your own safty, OT to be presented to the
cold, emotionless school board. This is for your saftey.
You don't want to "dissapear", right?

================================================================
In addition on keeping a list of every time a teacher breaks a rule
(in an attempt to fuel a revolution), I will now be making detailed
incident reports where I attempt to find a contradiction in the school's
rules.

One issue with my arguments is that for my "contridictions" to apply
you MUST assume that the school is geniunly trying to teach you
information. Any alterier motive, and my argument crumbels appart.
Of course schools don't want to teach you things! Its all a big excuse
for somthing bigger! But since most people in the school (Yes, even teachers)
belive that the school genuinly wants to help people (And some teachers truely do
but definitly not all)

The ideal school has these as their core principles:

1. Casue no harm.
2. Spark wonder
3. Encourage creativity
4. Everyone is equal
5. Gives the students human rights

Where by "Human Rigts" I mean the Universal List Of Human Rights
but to be mroe spesific:

1. Free Speech
2. No unnessesary searching
3. Everyone should have a reason to live
    A common issue with capitalism is making everyone a lifeless drone.
4. Right to privicy. (Universal Human Right 11)
    A common issue with capitalism is large corperations spying on their users.
    (Ahem, Google.)
5. Innocent untill proven guilty
    See #6
6. Right to a fair investigation (US 6th)
    This is not enforced at our school.
    If you are convicted of doing somthing wrong,
    there is no "trial" (investigation) to see if you
    actually did anything wrong in the first place.
7. No cruel punishment
8. Right to be forgotten
    Due to Spain's (or mabee the whole EU's) 'Right to be forgotten',
    you can request your data from google, AND ALSO LEAGALLY MAKE THEM DELETE IT!
    This does not apply to schools. If there were to be a data breach in the school
    (Happens a lot actually) 
9. Right to an unbiased judge
    Not only do we (mostly) never use a "judge" (counseler)
    but they are usually biased agenst the students in one way or another,
    Usually through the way you get called down. Im not sure whether I
    consider this as abelism but I do know that I hate it.
10. No discrimination
    Discrimination is leagal in the US. Isn't that kinda dumb?
    I mean, "hate crimes" exist, but if you yell a slur at someone
    you get no consequence. Sound a little off? Wait till you see schools!
    Discrimination is everywhere. Usually from tacher to student, but sometimes
    student to student.

These are my definitions of a "perfect" school. Of course, this ALONE would not make
a school perfect, but these aresimply guidelines.

If we assume that the school followes this rule list, we can find a lot of
contridictions. In addition, this list is slightly biased twards schools.

Due to this, "Teachers must not harm students" is a rule, but
"Teachers must help the students learn" is merly a seggestion.
This gives the school some edge in the situation as a teacher not teaching
can ge toff with a slap on the wrist through these rules.

Also, due to this, "Teachers treating everyone equally" is required,
but "Teachers treating everyone with respect" is not required.
A teacher treating everyone equally terribly is perfectly acceptible
in the rules.

These two "errors" in the rules (and probibly many more) give the school an
advantage. Frankly, they are going to need it.
