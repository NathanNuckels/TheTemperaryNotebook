[TCH] are very... agenst... They are agenst each other, they are agenst the students,
they are agenst the people who they claim to help and they sit agenst the wall.
Ok, that last one might not be what I mean but they are basically the only example I
can think of for an 'anti-guy'.

[TCH] work agenst students. Of course they don't want to but they do.
Some attack people cause its fun, some do it cause they think its good
but most do it cause its the only job they could get and seeing
how they always invade our privicy, more on that later, they
are probibly reading this right now as I type it. This is why I have
elected to cencor the word '[tch]' and '[scbrd]' by writing them
in short hand. I know they know too much. They know that I'm on to them,
but technically, if this file gets leeked, no one will be able to prove beond
a reasonable doubt that this file is about this place. All they will be able
to prove is that I suck at writing, belive I am a wistleblower, and that
there is an ad agency working with the [sch]. Again, more on that later.

Hello. My name is NOT Alan Grey and I'm here to give the rebels a warm welcome
to TheSuspiciousEssay, in TheForbiddenNotebook. The only unblocked place
on this pittiful planet that belivies that the [scbrd] is full of ****.

We have inside knowledge form yours truly, lists of crap that you can use as
evidence in court, or evidence not in court, or just evidence in general
for or agenst whatever.

Quick news: Project Blasphemy workds best when running alongside Project Draconic
however, Project Dragonic has been experiencing technical difficulties for
at least a week now so Project Blasphemy is looking for a new home!
Right now we're on GitHub.com but we can't stay here. We need somewhere
more private, like Project Draconic.

We did a little digging and determined the most common reason for
incidents like this is when people hate their jobs, but arnt alloud to leave.
They work this job and this job only untill they retire.
