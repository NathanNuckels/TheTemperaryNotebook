groups.txt

What groups do I belong to? Heh, I wish I could answer that question without
starting a riot but given the current state of the world I can't. Well... it is getting
better now but not completely... I wonder how long I can type while avoiding the subject...
Whats a community other than that that I can mention.... Heh... Nothing really...

Let me tell you about Linux. Trust me this is important.
A package group is a bunch of packages together. You don't need all of them, you don't need any of them really.

The group I belong ot is exactically like that. It has many people in it, but the group itself is never defined.
Most people say anyone that claims to be in the group is in it wiht the exception being that one dude that did
that chlorene gas attack in 2014-ish what we all remember. There's a reason people don't go to denver anymore...
Thankfully theres one in Texas that is unharmed and also one located in---
Uh oh. Poetry time.

One day
I will go to Mexaplex Pensylvania.
And find a bunch of people
all exactically like me.
Then I'll go home and suffer.
Be cause no one here is like them or like me.
Everyone here disagrees while
everyone there is the same.
Why can't we all be different and open minded at the same time?
Genuinly. Whats the problem here?
