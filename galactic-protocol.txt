Lets make an internet protocol for aliens cause I'm bored.

Ok, not really for aliens spesifically, but it should be simple to decipher,
like linux DEB packages. Someone with a lot of knowledge in linux
but no knowledge of .DEB files would be able to install a DEB file just
by messing with it.
Its a tarball. Inside it is another tarball you extract to the root folder.
(by root i mean / not /root/) and some metadata.

I want my format to be simple so thaat any technologically advanced society can understand it.
Of course, if you write in a human language, others won't understand but you can send pictures
that everyone understands... kinda. To define a proton you can make a circle with a + in it
but then you have to define what a + even is and...

Well, the point of this is they can decode the image, makeing an image that aliens can even
undertand... well, thats SETI's job.

Lets start defining things.

Transmit things in binary cause computers use binary.

Lets make packets.
I'll base it off of human TCP packets.
TCP stands for 'Transmission Controll Protocol'
Gotta love those 90s developers. So "creative"

Lets check the wikiapibia for info.
