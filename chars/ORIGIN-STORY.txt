This is the story of TEKNIQ, not the best engineer,
but definitly the most clever one.

He started out as a dragon that looked simaler to @SUSHI_FUR
and he built a protogen visor and wore it all the time.
This caused him to look very odd to all the real protogens
as he was less reptilian and more organic. Luckly for him,
there was a fasion trend happening where protogens ditched
a lot of their armor and tried changing their faces. TEKNIQ
noticed that not all Protogens could program, and created some
software wher instead of teh BIOS drawing their face, the OS
would do it. He made it very easy to edit. Just a config file
and a SVG file. Then he realized that it only worked on himself.

Kelides limped over to him.
KELIDES: D-Docter?
TEKNIQ:Uhh, I'm an engineer.
KELIDES: Same t-thing. Need your help. Low battery. Talk later.

He took Kelides in and charged him up.
TEKINQ: I also do software for Linux and stuff but I don't work with
living things.
KELIDES: Well, luckey you, I'm dead! ...technically.
TEKNIQ: W-wha-
KELIDES: Oh ya know, killed in the Percius war but man tech these
days got me feeling kinda sorta not dead yet.
TEKNIQ: Uhhh...
KELIDES: So... software?
TEKINQ: Uh yeah.. Just a thing to change your face. But it only works---
[Kelides picks up an M.2 drive and stares at it. He slides it into his head
between his ears.]
[His faces changes to a lot of different colors.]
KELIDES: Cool.
TEKNIQ: B-But it only works on me!
KELIDES: Where's the source code... here it is.
KELDIES: It dosn't work on LEAGAL protos. It works on us becasue we arn't
technically Protogens. 
TEKNIQ: Has anyone jailbrak-ed a proto before?
KELIDES: [smug] Not yet.
[He hands the drive back to TEKNIQ]
KELIDES: On start up, The FL-OS kernal is started. The kernal handles
the hardware and stuff. Its very complicated, but theres this little thing,
Linus's UNIX. LINUX if you will... Its a kernal. Premade. Use it.
TEKNIQ: How to I make the OS? How to I compile the code?
KELIDES: A team of people called GNU made some tools. Like, a LOT of tools.
You can use them as your OS, but it won't be good. Use them as the tools
to compile someone elses code. GNU is great, but you need a lot more than that
if you want somthing fancy.
TEKNIQ: Oh, that dosn't sound to hard... for me at least.
KELIDES: One problem. FL-OS isn't just the OS. Its also the BIOS and those
BIOS will refuse to boot to anything else.
TEKNIQ: Can I make my own BIOS?
KELIDES: No, you'd have to understand the exact hardware of a true protogen
down the the wire and know exactically how it connects to the nerves of
Sergals and Avali and such. No one in this universe knows that much.
TEKNIQ: What if you took the BIOS and tricked it into booting to Linux?
KELIDES: Good idea. I was a protogen when I was alive with original
locked down BIOS and everything. Now that I'm a zombie, I'm basically
just a regular computer. I replaced it with somthing much simpler
to make hacking easier but I still have a copy of the original.
Can you slip that drive back in my ear?
[TEKNIQ puts the drive in Kelides's ear]
KELIDES: Put it in that black slot.
[It clicks]
KELIDES: Ok. I got you a textbook on assembly language, a list of opcodes
for common proto processors, and the raw data from my old BIOS chip.
With that list of opcodes you should be able to decompile the code
and with a bit of hard work, you might be able to figure out how it works.
KELIDES: Also as a bonus, you can try figuring out what memory addresses
go to what nerves or whatever.
TEKNIQ: I- I want to try.
KELIDES: Are you a computer?
TEKNIQ: no.
KELIDES: Do you have a computer?
TEKNIQ: no.
KELIDES: W-Wha- Ok. Just use me.
KELIDES: Oh, and by the way, there are a lot of different species, all with
different biology. It would hock into their brains differently, and have different
wireing, and definitly ahve different code. Also, the same code could be on a
different processor with a different archetecture wich would have its own opcodes.
The 'load value to cache' command will be written differently on different processors
and the function that reads brain activity will deffinitly differ between species.
TEKNIQ: So there ould be millions of different BIOS sertups?
KELIDES: Exactially. Mine is MakéMaké 64 bit archetecture and If I recall correctly,
I was a Sergal.
TEKNIQ: Ok. I'll rename the file to note that.
KELIDES: Also, that opcode cheat ssheet is for AMD 64.
TEKNIQ: Yeah, It says it right there.
KELIDES: Ok. One more issue. X86 is NOT the same as X86-64. X86-64 is
the same as AMD64. Anything with "AARCH" in it is aarch64. Anything
with "ARM" in it is either ARMv7 or ARMv8. If it isn't either one of those,
I can't help you. Also, If someone says Their processor is the M3 or M1,
thats Makémaké.
TEKNIQ: Ok. I'm off to collect some code!
[Yelling as TEKNIQ walks out the door]
KELIDES: Remember, SkyLake is not an archetecture!!
