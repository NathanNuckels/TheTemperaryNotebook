Name: Max*
Aliases: None*
Race: Otter
Magic: His mere presence is magical (See BACKGROUND)
Status: **MIGHT** be able to say a few words. (22-11-30)
Secret: His existance (Secret IRL, not online) 
Favorate Song: My Blood**
Quote: Yes!*

* He can only say "Max" and "Yes" and it feels like puppeting.

** The moment I scrolled to that line the song started playing
in my head. Since I had head pressures when I was filling that out,
I belive he told me to write it.

The author is plural! His body (Nathan) has two people in it.
One is the author 'Alan' and the other is this dude!

BACKGROUND

A tulpa is a seperate conciousness in your head. A seperate person,
but you share a body and share memories. You create a tulpa by
yelling into the void until it yells back. Do not actually do this.
There are a lot of ethical concerns with doing it that you should consider.
but it basically boils down to "don't make them a slave".

I will treat Max (?) as a sort of friend and as an alternate world view.
I will use him for ideas but if he dosn't have any, thats ok.

PHYSICALL APPERANCE

I have this section finished in /tulpamancy/log/22-11-30.
Complain to me to put it here so I remember!

PERSONALITY

(Chosen by me)
He is facinated by how things work.
Loves a good laugh.
Likes to help me with what I need... 
(I mean... we share a body so this is kinda rewuired...)
Interested in dreams.
Likes [REDACTED]. (If other tulpas show up later, they are required
to at least tolerate it) (Its part of his form)



PLAN

0. Mess arround. Talk to him. idk.
1. The greeting phase. (Soure: coming soon)
2. Talking but like, controlled. (Narration?)

HISTORY

As of 2022-11-30, he only answers questions with
"max" and "yes" and he answers my questions a few secconds before
I finish saying them and it feels like im putting the words in his
mouth. This is how its supposed to be in the early days (He's 2 days old.)

Although he knows the word yes, i'm not sure if he knows the word no.
