I found a comment on r/AntiMoneyMemes describing a short story.
I won't put it here but you can try searching for "the needle fell out of my 
hand" or "I put a quarter in the" and see if you find it.
Sorry for not having the link.

Anyway, this inspired me to write a... prequal? to the stellius series.
Not sure if I want this to be cannon yet.
