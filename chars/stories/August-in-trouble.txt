KELDIES: Hey, August, somthing wrong?
AUGUST: Nah, nothing's wrong.
KELIDES: Really? I feel like you-
AUGUST: No, There' nothing wrong with me. I genuinly don't see the problem.
[AUGUST runs into a wall]
KELIDES: I think you can't genuinly see Êƒaik!
AUGUST: Language! I'm fine! Look!
[AUGUST walks rom one wall to another]
AUGUST: I see where everything is.
KELIDES: Oh really? What color are my eyes?
[KELIDES's face color changes to dark blue]
AUGUST: Orange of course.
KELIDES: Yeah you're blind...
AUGUST: Alright. There was an attack while I was getting an upgrade.
KELIDES: An attack at the hospital? What?
AUGUST: It was a small thing but I somehow still got caught up in it... as I always do...
KELIDES: Attack at the hospital... Man this KXAL dude just dosn't stop does he?
AUGUST: Anyway, I ran and reinstalled EVERYTHING just to be sure.
KELIDES: nd let me guess, graphics data is missing?
AUGUST: No, I have--- uhh... yeah I guess...
AUGUST: I feel a little faster cause I don't have to think about drawing my eyes.
It needs a large process, X, to be running.
KELIDES: Guess you don't have X installed
