HOW ITS MADE: LIFE
BY ALAN GRAY

What is up everybody, its TEKNIQ! Today I'm going to give you a tutorial
on how to raize the dead! I'll try my best but know that this is my first time too.
Episide One hundread fourty eight: BRAINS!

From the wiring tutorial, this Protogen now has a massive pin header in the back of his neck.
By putting ground in ground and five volts in the other holes, you can move his body.
We did this last time to test the moters but this time we just need to make sure
its facing the right way. Ground is on one of the corners, Above it should be
RIGHT_WRIST_OUT. Try connecting that to five volts. If nothing happens, swap
the connections or try the other side. Once you find it, make a line next to ground
so you don't forget. Now you can plug it in to the brain correctly.
But how do you build the brain?
