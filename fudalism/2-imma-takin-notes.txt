IMMA TAKIN NOTES - Alan Gray
(Blues style)
This song is not 3/4. It is 4/4.

Ya see me walkin right in; in the back of the class [Alan is often mysterious]
Yeah I aint dead yet. [This implies that the teacher wants them dead for one reason or another]
No I aint dead yet.
Ya see me watchin yo every move [Alan seens to be keeping tabs on the teacher]
But I ain't no threat. [This implies that the teacher feels threatened simply by Alan being in the room]
No I aint no thre~at.

You start to aproach me
try to take a stand
You walk right over
and list your demands [The teacher has 'demands' for Alan]

I take out my papers ['Papers' could mean notes, or identification to prove that he is just being himself]
and I try to choke [He uses 'choke' instead of talk to mean that he talks in a way where no one will listen]
that IM JUST TAKIN NOOOOOOTES! [He tries to cover up the fact that he is a poet]

I see your lies are colliding. [Lies often contridict eachther]
Secrets are confining. [Secrets are anoying becasue you can't tell anyone]
I see you boring right at me ['bore' as in drill. They are staring right through him.]
I know you won't go politly. [The teacher won't go down without a fight.]

[to be continured]
