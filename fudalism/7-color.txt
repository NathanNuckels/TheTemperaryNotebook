[Pre]
I look outside and see
Who I want to be
They convinced me
That I'm wrong
wrong
Its just before my eyes
The love of this light
They say that I lie
So I'm wrong.
but
[Courus]
I will not be
I think I see
I'm seeing colors.
Somthings wrong with my mind
I see the light
For the first time
I'm seeing COLORS.
Somthings wrong
with my
mind
