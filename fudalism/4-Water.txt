Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du
I~
Get no compensation
for my screwed up occupation
got me workin
nine to nine 'n night time
suspended in my fright
got me thinkin bout the world at large
and how I should have stayed in charge.
I think I wanna go back twen I could just be me, ye-ah

Oh~

You mke me climb the tower
And then I start to cower
And then you cut my pa~y again
no no

I try to make myself near
a little overworked here
but now I'm fallin farther
And fallin in your water

(I'm not cannon fodder)
(And I'm fallling farther) [pls verify]
I'm trapped in these walls.
(N-not your real a-a-) [verify]

Don't even bother
It makes me feel taller
but I'm gettin clobbered
and pulled from by wa~ter
