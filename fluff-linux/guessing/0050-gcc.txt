[Needs ISO C++11 compiler]
[Needs stanard libraries]
[BINUTILS is needed]
[Make is needed]
[GNU GMP sources is needed in subdir]
[MPFR sources needed in subdir [https://www.mpfr.org]
[MPC sources needed in subdir [https://www.multiprecision.org/mpc]
[Tar and xzip are "required" to extract the archive BUT this COULD
be done on another computer.]
[Testing requires tcl, expect and dejagnu]

0050.01 Getting the code.
    0050.01.1 GCC
        wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/gcc-12.2.0/gcc-12.2.0.tar.xz
    0050.01.2 GNU GMP
        wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gmp/gmp-6.2.1.tar.xz
    0050.01.3 MPFR
        wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/mpfr/mpfr-4.1.1.tar.xz
    0050.01.4 MPC
        wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/mpc/mpc-1.2.1.tar.xz
    0050.01.5 Extract everything correctly
        tar xf gcc-12.2.0.tar.xz
        cd gcc-12.2.0
        tar xf ../gmp-6.2.1.tar.xz
        tar xf ../mpfr-4.1.1.tar.xz
        tar xf ../mpc-1.2.1.tar.xz
        # NOTE: This is done in Linux From Scratch.
        # The GNU instructions don't mention it.
        mv gmp-6.2.1 gmp
        mv mpfr-4.1.1 mpfr
        mv mpc-1.2.1 mpc
0050.02 Configuration
    # "First, we highly recommend that GCC be built into a separate directory
    # from the sources which does not reside within the source tree. This
    # is how we generally build GCC; building where srcdir == objdir should
    # still work, but doesnâ€™t get extensive testing; building where objdir
    # is a subdirectory of srcdir is unsupported."
    
    # You can't have the build folder be a sub folder of the source folder.
    # But LFS does this for some reason...?
    # But I wont!
    cd ..
    mkdir gcc-build
    cd gcc-build
    ../gcc-12.2.0/configure \
        --with-pkgversion="GCC home-made [INSERT DATE HERE]"
        # pkgversion is optional, it just adds a little flare to gcc --version
        --prefix=/usr/pkg
        --program-suffix=-fluff
        # renames gcc to gcc-fluf to tell the difference.
        --enable-threads
        --enble-languages=c,c++
0050.03 Compilation
    # WARNING: THE CONFIGURE COMMAND ABOVE IS A **GUESS**
    # I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I'M DOING!!!
    
    # Find out how many cores your CPU has, multiply by two.
    # Replace my '16' with your number.
    make -j16
0050.04 Testing
    make -j16 -k check
    #This is gonna take a wile
    # Reading results:
    # PASS is good
    # XPASS is unexpected PASS.
    # FAIL is bad
    # XFAIL is good. Its Expected FAIL so its OK
    # UNSUPPORTED means nothing.
    # ERROR or WARNING could be a you problem OR could be the test being weird.
0050.05 Install
    make DESTDIR=/mnt/fluff/fakeroot/gcc-12.2.0 install
