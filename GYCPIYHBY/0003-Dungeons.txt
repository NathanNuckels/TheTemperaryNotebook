I am the dngeon keeper.
I manage the dungeon.
Keep the prisioners fed and the beasts starved.
(Prisioner and explorer are played by the shadow self)
Keep prisioners, keep beasts, keep tresure, all the usual stuff.
Cold and humid. The torches are nice though, if I can remember to keep them lit.
I am a guard. I guard the prisioners and make sure they can't escape.
Prisioners come and go over the years but Ive just staied here.
What if I'm the prisioner?
We're inside a moutan, I think, I can't remember.
All I know are these walls. I have nothing else to talk about.
I'll tell you about the place.
Hallways. Cells. The usual prision stuff.
...
I overheared my manager complaining about "too many slaves!"
and "not enough food!" but I'm not supposed to pay for the food,
I just deliver it. Also, I've suffered plenty of riots in my time.
"WE WANT OUT!"
"No."
"Well why are we here?"
"Ask the Dungeon Lord"
"But he never visits the dungeon!"
"If you really want to know why you're here, I'll write a letter."

Suddenly, all the prisioners start yelling for answers.
----------------
He wrote back.
There is no reason. He is just trying to get payed.
So we're breaking out!
