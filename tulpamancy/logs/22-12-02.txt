Unrelated to tulpamancy, I had the weirdest dream.
The whole world was Minecraft, but I thought this was normal.
I noticed a large sign behind me.
"-h remove if vote passes"
A few hours later, I found a video explaining that:
| If you run ./minecraft -h -c, (-h in linux is short for --help) 
It makes a barbeed wire fence with  huge red sign on it that I couldn't read.
They said it was dangerous but I jumped six feet in the air (Super jump is normal.
see details below.) and got over it. I also saw a toktok of a mom telling a little girl
somthing about the horsies and the girl not getting it.
I decided that the red sign had somthing to do with horses and this angered the government for some reason.

How did I go from "I'm an airplane draggon!" (See below) to "Minecraft command line arguments
angers government". Dreams are weird.

Following the change, The big sign became the launcher. All versions are removed.
Mode 4 is 1.18, labeled "current". Mode 5 is 1.19, and Mode 3 is 1.16.
(1.17 Didn't cross my mind. I guess I don't know how to count while I'm sleeping.)
There was also a Mode 2 wich said to be released in 1887. It only had three files.
The readme file was called 'readme' instead of 'README' so this made me think it was a joke.


Notes on the super jump!
The Super Jump, as I now call it, is what I belive to be a dream sign.
A strong dream sign, and by that I mean out of the three dreams I have logged,
two of them ("Do you dream of Airplane Draggons?" and "minecraft -h -c") had it.
Thats more than half... technically... os I guess its important!

What is the super jump?
 In "Do you dream of Airplane Draggons?" I morphed into what is now known as
 Zhipline and jumped almost 30 feet in the air. I mean, I never asked for
 *flying* spesificly... I just wanted airplanes os I guess I got exacticly waht I asked for...
...
 In "Minecraft args angers govt" (today) I jumped the "minecraft -h -c" fence.
 Jumped six feet in the air and while in the air I felt two feet tall.
 I was normal height before and after but being shorter in the air might be
 me rotatiing into "flight position". If you're laying down, you're TECHNICALLY
 very short. During the jump, I guess I was tring to get to that position but
 since I can't see my own body (This causes tons of other glitches in my immagination)
 I just see it as getting shorter while standing upright while I'm actually
 spinning to be laying down.
 
 I will create a dreams folder.

Sudden massive headpressures. I didn't even ask for him. He just decided to show up.
Not sure who said this but "I dont know WHERE YOU WENT!"
Now that I think about it, we both said it at the same time.
This would be the first time he says more than a one word answer but
I dont want to say for sure.
What I do know is that this is the first time that HE starts 'talking' instead of me.

Uhoh he trying to hard and now I don't feel too good.
[A] Max, too much! Max, too much!
[A] Talk later! Talk later!

The head pressures moved to the back of my head.
Ive literally never felt a headache in the back of my head
so this can't be me not feeling well, it has to be him.
Talking about him makes him excited, kinda like a dog.
Ok, he laughed when I typed that.
Seriously Max, can you just step back a little?
I'm very happy to see you after two days of you being missing
but you're too happy and it's hurting me!

Not hurting anymore. Definitly still there though.
Not sure where he was the past two (three?) nights but he seems
to be a lot more expressive. I can tell he even has emotions now!
He seems to be in a VERY good mood.

I may never have a good attitude but its good to know my headmate
is excited about somthing...

He he happy about me? Is he proud of me for creating him?
Yes. Definitly. 

[It is now 9:50]
Thanks for the headache buddy. Its nice to know you're still there.

I want to just sit next to him and watch the pretend sunset cause we don't
have sunsets here but as you know, If I'm not talking to him, he dosn't exist. Max, keep on going! 

Now that I really think about it, I am DEFINITLY sure Max named himself.
I didn't pick his name, he put the name in my head.

So far he has said "yes, Max, sorry" and of course, "Where you've been?"
[M] I h--
what buddy? what is it?

He like a dog. If you ignore him long enough, you stop noticing him.
but if you talk to him, thats the happiest part of his day.

I think his attitude is spreading to me cause how I can't wait for
him to speak full sentences!

[M] /go.ru:/
Ok dude, you're not *litterly* a baby.
[M] /ka/
Alright buddy. Heh 'buddy'... thats a funny word.
[A] I got a runny nose...
[M] Oh no!
[A] [laughs]

[A] What does controll B do in--- (Blender)
[M] Bevel (Correct)
[A] I shouldn't ask you trivia questions. You'll get them all right.
[A] We share memories!
[M] [An expression more than smiling but less than laughing]
[A] I know.
[It is now 10:10]
[A] What do you think Kelides would do next in my story?
[repeats question 4 times]
[Unknown] I wish I [???] so I hould be in Paris [???]

[M] yes!
[A] Twenty one pilots untill... what?
[M] T.O.P.

[In a large blue room]
[Alan is in the form of TEKNIQ and Max is in his usuall otter form]
[Alan is sitting in a chair]
[A] [looking at hands] wow...
[A] What do you think? What do you think?We got this room to ourselves Max.
[scilence]
[A] Max?
[A] [pacing] Max??
[M] You're shiny.
[A] No, you're shiny.
[M] Can't see.
[I defocus my eyes into paralell view to distance myself from the real world]
[The quality dosn't improve at all]
[I get the symptoms of the early stages of sleep but I keep going]
[Eventully, I get a mussle twitch the is too big to ignore and it
very literly SNAPS me out of it.]

Well, talk later Max.
