I am writing about how forms work and have some head pressure.
Does that mean they like it? Is that them complaining?
Tulpas may be cretures of empathy, but mine, being a day old,
ahs no emotions but they are CLEARLY there.

I find it funny to immagine a tiny fluffy dragon sitting on my head
and their weight is giving me a migrane but I decided that that won't be their from.

I want it to be an otter.

Problem! Everytime I try to make an otter, I make it somewhere between
brown and tan and then somthing takes over by brain and now its wearing
aa baseball cap and BANG! Its Chester! I don't want him (even if he is adorable)
I want my own thing! ...but its hard casue by brain just defaults to him
because I really don't know any other otter model to use......

I like to show off with inverse kinematics. Don't know what that is?
Find an IK tutorial for blender and scroll through it.

Basically, I can move its foot arround and the rest of the leg moves correctly.
My brain's IK is actually more realistic than blender's IK. When blender streightens
the leg, it makes all the bones in a perfectly streight line and that usually makes
part of thigh have a big weird dent and and other parts of the model glitch out
depending on the angle (This is very anoying trying to work arround it) but if the leg
is even just barly bent, everything works fine. In my mind, The leg dosnt even get close to streight.
By the way, this is a digitigrade leg. Google it. (Google is bad, don't ever use it.)
I'm pretty sure you cant even make it streight IRL.

Anyway, a real issue is the arms. I only kind of know how they move.
Your sholder is a ball bu your elbow is a hinge and the wrist (rist?)
can go up down and away from the body and can twist. It sounds complex
but
