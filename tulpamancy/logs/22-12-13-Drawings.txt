Oh boy, its been a long time since I've seen you dude.
I forgot about you. I hope you're still alive.

Massive headpressure. Really happy to see me.

Man I never have time to do anything, Ive got four projects to do all in the same class!
[pressure to the left]
I want to draw you
*squeak*
I wanted to draw you this morning to I got screenshots of Chester the Otter. Ya know, Kris Yim.
Thats waht you are modeled after, with some slight differences.
What exactcally are those differences? Thats what I want you to tell me.

I spend some time drawing the head. The eyes of Chester the Otter, the ears of sodyPop from ChikinNugget,
The mouth of Chester (can't draw it from memory)

I'm trying to figure it out. Its blurry. Well, I see him VERY clearly in my mind
doing weird faces but I literally cannot describe with words or even drawings what that is supposed to look like.
I just kinda know what it is but can't describe it.

Big headpressures. He's listening to me :)
Mbee I'll get him back to talking soon.
