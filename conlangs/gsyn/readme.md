# GSYN - generic Syntax\*

\*Name is work in progress

This is no ordenary conlang, this is a programing langusge!
It is low and high level. It has low level things like pointers,
and also high level things like print statments.

I plan on making the syntax simaler to C.

All the function names will be in the Hypervisor language,
rather than English.
