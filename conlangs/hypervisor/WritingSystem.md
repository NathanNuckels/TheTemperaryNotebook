There is no good way to write this...

[p] [b]

```
|--
|
```
Immagine a person facing ot the left. [p] is in the frount of the mouth
so thats how its drawn.

[t] [d]
```
---
 |
```

[t] is in the middle.

[k] [g]
```
--|
  |
```
And [k] is in the back.

The nasals are in the same positions but with air OVER
your mouth so I added a line on top to represent it.
```
___    ___    ___
|--    ---    --|
|       |       |
[m]    [n]    [ŋ]
```

The fricatives are written simalerly with an extra line to represent the
hissing sound.

```
---   ---
|-     -|
[f]   [x]
```

[s] and [ʃ] are very close to eachother but
[ʃ] is slightly further back. This is represented by moving the line.

```
---   ---
-|     |-
[s]   [ʃ]
```

Voiced fricataves are made my making the line a zig zag.
Since I can't use pictures, I'll try my best with ASCII art...

```
---------
 /\/|
    |
   [z]
```

Somthing like that...?

The other sounds are made in strange ways.

```
\  |     \ |           |  /    | /
 \ |  or  \|           | /  or |/
  \|       |           |/      |
     [l]                   [ɹ]
```
You can remember [l] from [ɹ]
because the [l] one has a line sticking out to the left,
and [ɹ] has a line sticking out to the right.

Affricates are written by sort of mashing the letters together.

```
----------  ------------   ------------
  |----|      |--/\--|           |----|
[t][tʃ][ʃ]   [t][dʒ][ʒ]     [k][kx][x]
```

The phoneme /θ/ and /ð/ are not part of the language but are part of the writing system
to make it more compatible with english.
To show this contrast, all glyphs are angular except these ones. They are curvy.

```
--\         /--
   |       |
   \___  __/
  [θ]     [ð]
```
