# REASOING

So every language has /p/ /t/ /k/
and I know I want to use /x/.
Since I have the 
Bilabial, alveolar and velar plosives, I slould add the
Bilabial, alveolar and velar nasals, /m/ /n/ /ŋ/.
Friticate time. To keep things semetrical, you WOULD add
the bilabial alveolar and velar fritactives, wich are
/ɸ/ /s/ and /x/ and I really like /x/ but /ɸ/ is weird.
I THINK I can pronounce it, but it just feels off and when
reading quickly I would probibly just say /f/ anyway so...
/f/ is in. Also add the Voiced versions of the fritaves.
This brings us up to /f/ /v/ /s/ /z/ /x/ /ɣ/.
Also, I can pronounce /x/ and /ɣ/ but when reading stuff
and moving quickly I use them interchangibly.
I want to say somthing smart like "Its /x/ before a vowel,
and /ɣ/ after a vowel" but idk lets just say their interchangible.
Lets also make all plosives not care about voicing.
/p/ can be either [p] or [b], /k/ i [k] and [g] etc...
Lets also add /ʃ/ and /ʒ/ to make it more simaler to English. 
I plan on making a lot of small words (pronouns) be like 
Spanish and big words be like English. Also, for the same reason,
I'll also add /θ/ and /ð/ (Sometimes written as þ) to the language. 
Not in any of the words, but I'll add it to the writing system.
They will be written a lot differently than the other symbols
to symbolize that they are not in the language.

What do we got... p t k m n ŋ f v s z ʃ ʒ x ɣ* θ* ð*.
Thats good. Lets add some of the odd sounds. Lets add
some approximants and other stuff. /ɹ/ /j/ /l/ seem good
to me.

Vowels!

According to Artifaxian (Artefexian?) lanuages need a front
vowel, [a] a back vowel [o], and a rounded vowel [o].
He used [a] [i] and [o] but I want more variety for dipthongs later down
the road so lets take the japanese vowels. [a] [i] [u] [e] [o]
and add the english shwaa [ə] and since we have
one vowel at every corner or the IPA chart,
lets just add [ɑ] for completeness.
Actually nevermind. I don't like it.

Ok. Back to consonents with afracates. Plosive plus fritatave.
They ar equite fun to work with and I accidently said [k͡xa]
one time and I like it a lot so lets add it.
Lets list every possable affratact with the phonemes that I alloued.
[pf] [bv] [ts] [dz] [tʃ] [dʒ] [kx] [ɡɣ]
Now I'll keep [tʃ] [dʒ] and [kx]. Also, since
[k] and [g] are the same and [x] and [ɣ] are the same,
[kx] and [ɡɣ] are the same.
I've never said [g͡ɣa] before but I'll
try it at home. See if I like it.

Lastly, dipthongs.
I'll try every possable dipthong and keep the ones I like.

|x|a|i|u|e|o|ə|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|a|aa|ai|au|ae|ao|aə|
|i|ia|ii|iu|ie|io|iə|
|u|ua|ui|uu|ue|uo|uə|
|e|ea|ei|eu|ee|eo|eə|
|o|oa|oi|ou|oe|oo|oə|
|ə|əa|əi|əu|əe|əo|əə|

and heres the ones I'm keeping.

|x|a|i|u|e|o|ə|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|a|a|ai|au||ao
|i|ia|i|iu|ie|io|iə
|u|ua|ui|u|ue
|e|ea|ei||e
|o|oa|oi|ou|oe|o|
|ə||əi|əu|||ə
